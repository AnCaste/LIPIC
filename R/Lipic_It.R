#' @title Lipic_It
#'
#' @description Performs both Type I and Type II corrections in lipid class-related mass spectra.
#'  To this purpose, however, the dmz values (i.e. the absolute error in monoisotopic m/z
#'  estimation) need to be specified for each sum composition.
#'  Typically, such values are initially unknown. In this case, the user should employ
#'  "Lipic_It" rather than "Lipic" function. Indeed, "Lipic_It" follows a recursive algorithm
#'  leading to a reliable estimation of dmz values. After the last iteration, the Type I and Type II
#'  correction results are shown.
#'  Specifically, "Lipic_It" returns the values of the lipid Relative Abundances compared with both
#'  the "Most Abundant Lipid" and the "Lipid Class".
#'  The former indicates the percentage ratio between the signal intensity of a specific
#'  lipid sum composition and the highest intensity detected in the mass spectrum.
#'  The latter corresponds to the percentage ratio between the signal intensity of
#'  that sum composition and the overall intensity measured for the whole lipid class.
#'  If equal ionization yields are assessed, "Lipid Class" percent Relative Abundances
#'  can be considered equivalent to the mole fraction percentage of the sum compositions.
#'  In the "Lipic_It" output data frame, both "Most Abundant Lipid" and "Lipid Class"
#'  percent Relative Abundances are defined as "Adj" or "Un-Adj". Precisely, "Adj"
#'  (Adjusted) indicates that the relative abundances are computed after both Type I
#'  and Type II corrections. Conversely, Un-Adj (UnAdjusted) Relative Abundances are
#'  calculated using only Type I correction.
#'  The bar chart generated in the RStudio viewer pane at the end of "Lipic_It"
#'  calculations shows the interactive comparison between the "Adj" and "Un-Adj"
#'  values of "Lipid Class" percent Relative Abundances. This graphical output allows the
#'  user to perceive the extent of Type II correction in his experimental mass spectrum.
#'  Moreover, the reliability of the corrections performed by "Lipic_It" can be evaluated
#'  by requesting the comparison between the real mass spectrum and the
#'  simulated mass spectra obtained after either Type I or both Type I and Type II
#'  corrections. Subsequently, a new plot is generated in the RStudio viewer pane.
#'  Here, these spectra are named "Uncorrected Simulated Spectrum" (Type I correction) and
#'  "Corrected Simulated Spectrum" (Type I and Type II correction). The user can also
#'  choose which spectra need to be removed from spectral superimposition by clicking on
#'  the corresponding line in the legend panel.
#'
#' @param data A data frame reporting the recognized sum compositions in the first column.
#' Conversely, the corresponding chemical formulas, the measured m/z, the dmz, and the
#' absolute intensity values need to be listed in the second, third, fourth and fifth
#' columns respectively.
#' N.B. All the elements in the data frame must be sorted following the ascending
#' order of the measured m/z value. Furthermore, the "dmz" column must be filled with 0.
#' Please, check the "CLmix" data frames included in the LIPIC package
#' as an example of data organization of the "Lipic_It" input data frame.
#' @param z Charge of the lipid ions. The charge sign needs to be specified.
#' @param Res Operating resolution of the mass analyzer.
#' @param t Probability below which isotope peaks can be omitted.
#' Refer to the "isopattern" function in the "enviPat" package for details.
#' @param span The "span" parameter value required by the "pick.peaks" function.
#' This function is included in the "LIPIC" package, but belongs to the
#' "ChemometricsWithR" package.
#' @param ppm Accuracy threshold (in ppm) required by the "dmzFind" function.
#' @param xseq Increment in the sequence of the m/z values used for the calculation
#' of the simulated mass spectrum employed in dmz calculation. "xseq" is set to 0.001
#' as default. Higher values reduce the computation time, but can lower the accuracy by
#' which the dmz values are retrieved by the "dmzFind" function.
#'
#' @return A data frame which is an extension of the input data frame.
#' The first five columns are identical to those of the input data frame, except the dmz
#' column (i.e. the fourth column), which contains the dmz estimated values for each sum composition.
#' The accuracy of "Lipic_It" correction is strictly dependent on the reliability of dmz values.
#' These are recursively calculated until convergence and the overall content of the output data
#' frame reflects the results of the last iteration.
#' Precisely, the sixth column shows the intensity values after Type II correction.
#' The seventh column shows the intensity values after both TypeII and Type I corrections.
#' As indicated by the corresponding headers, the remaining columns show the "Adj" and "Un-Adj"
#' "Lipid Class" percent Relative Abundance and the "Adj" and "Un-Adj" "Most Abundant Lipid"
#' percent Relative Abundance (see the above description section for details).
