#' @description Data frame with stable isotopes. N.B.: Isotope Table is analogous to the
#' "isotopes" data frame in the "einviPat" package and was added to "LIPIC" for technical
#' reasons. Thus, the user can refer to the "isotopes" help page in the enviPat package
#' for further details on the Isotope Table content.
