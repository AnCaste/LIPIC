Description: The LIPIC package is focused on the correction of Type I and Type II isotopic effects in lipid class-related High-Resolution Mass Spectra.
    Briefly, the Type II isotopic effect refers to the alteration of the M+0 peak intensity induced by the overlap with M+2 or even M+4 isotopologue peaks of lipids having one or two additional double bonds, respectively.
    Type II isotopic effect is largely common in mass spectra carried out by shotgun or by HILIC-MS.
    Moreover, Type I isotopic effect (i.e. the reduction of M+0 intensity due to the increase of the amount of  C atoms in the molecule) needs to be considered for quantitative purposes.
    Since the extent of both Type I and Type II isotope effects increases with the overall C atom number, the corresponding corrections are strongly recommended in mass spectra of large lipid molecules (e.g. cardiolipins, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines, gangliosides).
    Both Type I and Type II corrections are performed by the LIPIC package main functions, namely Lipic and Lipic_It.
